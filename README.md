GrowthForecast is used to predict weight-at-age 1 and 2 years forward for use in harvest control rules used by the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council. The package includes various parametric, semi-parametric, and machine learning based growth models. The package is designed to evaluate the retrospective forecast skills of each growth model and provide 1 and 2 year weight-at-age predictions from the model with the best predictive skill.
